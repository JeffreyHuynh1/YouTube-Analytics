## YouTube Analytics
An application that allows users to compare metrics such as views, likes, and subscriber count between two YouTubers. The application also allows users to look up in depth metric details of your own YouTube channel (An example of such a metric would be how many views on a particular video came from Canada during the time period of 12/1/19 - 1/1/20).
